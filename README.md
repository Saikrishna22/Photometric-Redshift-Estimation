# Photometric-Redshift-Estimation
### Estimating Photometric Redshift using Deep learning
---
### Definition:
* **Redshift** - A redshift reveals how an object in space (star/planet/galaxy) is moving compared to us. It lets astronomers measure a distance for the most distant objects in our universe. Most distant objects are the oldest.
* **Photometric redshift** - The technique uses photometry (that is, the brightness of the object viewed through various standard filters, each of which lets through a relatively broad passband of colours, such as red light, green light, or blue light) to determine the redshift, and hence, through Hubble's law, the distance, of the observed object.
